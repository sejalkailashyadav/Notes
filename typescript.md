# TypeScript React App

This project is a demonstration of a React application utilizing TypeScript. Here you will find useful examples of TypeScript concepts integrated in a React application.

## Setup Instructions

You can create your own TypeScript-React application by using the `create-react-app` utility with the TypeScript template:

### Using NPX:
```bash
npx create-react-app . --template typescript
```
or

### Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn create-react-app . --template typescript
```
or

```bash
npx create-react-app finance-tracker --template typescript
```

## TypeScript Concepts Covered

### Basic Types
TypeScript includes number, boolean, string, array, tuple, enum, any, void, null, undefined, never, and object.

### Variable Declaration
TypeScript uses `let` and `const` for variable declaration.

### Type Annotations and Inference
TypeScript allows you to explicitly define the type of a variable using type annotations, like `let name: string = 'John'`. TypeScript also has type inference, where it automatically infers the type of a variable based on the initial assigned value.

### Interfaces
Interfaces are powerful ways to define contracts within your code and contracts with code outside of your project.

### Classes
TypeScript has full support for classes and integrates them with interfaces, giving you a way to work with object-oriented programming in your TypeScript code.

### Functions
TypeScript function interfaces allow you to describe function types. You can annotate parameters and return values like any variable.

### Generics
Generics provide a way to make components work with any data type and not restrict to one data type. So components can be reusable and maintainable.

### Modules
TypeScript has internal and external modules to manage large applications.

### Decorators
Decorators are special kinds of declarations that can be attached to class declarations, method, accessor, property, or parameter.

### Namespaces
Namespaces are used for grouping logically related code. This is to prevent the global scope from getting polluted.

### TypeScript with React/ Angular/ Vue
TypeScript can be used with popular front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.

### TypeScript with Node.js
TypeScript can also be used in backend development with Node.js.

### Linting with TSLint
Linting is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

### Compilation
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so it needs to be compiled down to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`).

### TypeScript Configuration with tsconfig.json
TypeScript uses `tsconfig.json` for managing your project's options, such as which files to include and exclude, target JavaScript version, sourceMap, etc.
