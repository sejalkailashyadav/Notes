1. **What is Express.js?**
   - **Answer:** Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js designed for building robust and scalable web applications. It simplifies the creation of APIs and handling HTTP requests.

2. **Explain Middleware in Express.js.**
   - **Answer:** Middleware functions in Express.js have access to the request, response, and next middleware function. They can modify the request and response objects or end the request-response cycle. Example:

      ```javascript
      app.use((req, res, next) => {
        console.log('Middleware executed');
        next();
      });
      ```

3. **What is routing in Express.js?**
   - **Answer:** Routing in Express.js refers to determining how an application responds to a client request. It involves defining routes and associating them with specific handler functions. Example:

      ```javascript
      app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Hello, World!');
      });
      ```

4. **How does Express handle HTTP requests?**
   - **Answer:** Express handles HTTP requests by matching the request's path and method to defined routes, then executing the corresponding handler function.

5. **Explain the role of the `body-parser` middleware.**
   - **Answer:** `body-parser` is used to parse the body of incoming HTTP requests. It extracts data from the request body and makes it accessible through `req.body`. Example:

      ```javascript
      const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
      app.use(bodyParser.json());
      ```

6. **What is template engine in Express.js?**
   - **Answer:** A template engine in Express.js allows dynamic rendering of HTML by embedding values from the server. Examples include EJS, Handlebars, and Pug.

7. **What is RESTful routing in Express.js?**
   - **Answer:** RESTful routing in Express.js follows the principles of REST, defining routes and actions that correspond to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

8. **Explain the concept of middleware chaining.**
   - **Answer:** Middleware chaining involves applying multiple middleware functions to a route in a specific order. Each middleware function can modify the request or response and pass control to the next middleware using `next()`.

9. **What is the purpose of the `app.use()` method in Express.js?**
   - **Answer:** `app.use()` is used to mount middleware functions at a specified path. It applies middleware globally or to a specific route.

10. **What is the purpose of the `express.static` middleware?**
    - **Answer:** `express.static` is used to serve static files (such as images, CSS, and JavaScript) directly from a specified directory.

11. **Explain the role of the `morgan` middleware.**
    - **Answer:** `morgan` is a logging middleware for Express.js, providing information about incoming requests, such as request method, status, and response time.

12. **What is the purpose of the `Express Router`?**
    - **Answer:** `Express Router` is used to create modular and mountable route handlers. It helps organize route handling in larger applications.

13. **How does error handling work in Express.js?**
    - **Answer:** Error handling in Express.js involves defining a middleware function with four parameters `(err, req, res, next)`. This function is called when an error occurs during request processing.

      ```javascript
      app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
        console.error(err.stack);
        res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
      });
      ```

14. **Explain the concept of route parameters.**
    - **Answer:** Route parameters in Express.js are placeholders in the route pattern that capture values from the URL. They are accessible in the handler function through `req.params`.

      ```javascript
      app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
        const userId = req.params.id;
        res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
      });
      ```

15. **What is the purpose of the `cookie-parser` middleware?**
    - **Answer:** `cookie-parser` is used to parse cookies from the incoming request. It makes cookie data accessible through `req.cookies`.

      ```javascript
      const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
      app.use(cookieParser());
      ```

16. **Explain the difference between `app.get()` and `app.post()` in Express.js.**
    - **Answer:** `app.get()` is used to handle HTTP GET requests, while `app.post()` is used for handling HTTP POST requests. They define route handlers for different HTTP methods.

17. **How can you handle form submissions in Express.js?**
    - **Answer:** Form submissions in Express.js can be handled by using the `body-parser` middleware to parse the form data from `req.body`.

      ```javascript
      const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
      app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

      app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
        const formData = req.body;
        // Process form data
        res.send('Form submitted!');
      });
      ```

18. **What is the purpose of the `express-session` middleware?**
    - **Answer:** `express-session` is used to manage session data in Express.js applications. It creates a session object, which can store data between requests.

      ```javascript
      const session = require('express-session');
      app.use(session({ secret: 'mySecretKey', resave: false, saveUninitialized: true }));
      ```

19. **How do you perform route protection/authentication in Express.js?**
    - **Answer:** Route protection can be achieved by placing middleware before the route handler that checks whether the user is authenticated. If not, it redirects or returns an error.

      ```javascript
      const authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
        if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
          return next();
        }
        res.redirect('/login');
      };

      app.get('/protected-route', authenticate, (req, res) => {
        res.send('Protected Route');
      });
      ```

20. **Explain the concept of Express.js sub-applications.**
    - **Answer:** Sub-applications in Express.js are instances of `express()` that can be mounted as middleware using `app.use()`. This helps modularize and reuse code.

      ```javascript
      const subApp = express();
      subApp.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Sub-Application');
      });

      app.use('/sub', subApp);
      ```

21. **How can you secure Express.js applications?**
    - **Answer:** Secure Express.js applications by using HTTPS, validating user input, implementing authentication, enabling security headers, and keeping dependencies updated. Additionally, use tools like Helmet for security.

      ```javascript
      const helmet = require('helmet');
      app.use(helmet());
     ```
